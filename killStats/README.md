This plugin is for the game MineCraft. This code is very old and not guarunteed to work with the current version of MineCraft.

I created this plugin back in December of 2012. To be exact, my original project folder was created on 12/18/12 4:28pm. What once started
started out as a small hobby project turned into a big plugin that was being used by many many servers. I spent a lot of time working with
this code and trying to make it better as time went on. Real life hit me in the face around may of 2015 and work on this project slowly 
faded. I dropped the project and never checked back into it until recently when I received an email from a Spigot user who wanted to 
continue work for the plugin. I have not been on minecraft in quite some time so not really sure how popular PvP servers are anymore but
I hope by making this open source someone can make something of this plugin and get it back to working order with the most recent updates
to Spigot and Minecraft.

If you download this project and modify/distribute this plugin please give credit to the original creater. Any questions/comments will be
sent to my email from GitHub so I will be keeping track and helping in any way I can. I just cannot dedicate the amount of time that I 
once did into this project.
