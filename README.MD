# Donald Crawford's Plugins
Maintained repository with all of ImDeJay's Bukkit/Spigot page plugins.

### Why?
A while ago, I contacted the author to check if the source code was available for his plugins because it no longer seemed to work anymore on newer servers.

He agreed to release the source code because he was no longer maintaining it, as a result, his entire plugin collection is not released, so here I am updating these plugins to work for newer versions :).

### Updates
Updates may be pushed out periodically to address small bugs. Report issues in the 'issues' tab.
