# Donald Crawford's Plugins
Maintained repository with all of ImDeJay's Bukkit/Spigot page plugins.

## IMPORTANT
- Because only 1.8+ versions are available on the official Spigot Maven repository, and we want this code to be compilable for all... the plugins here have been updated only to support 1.8+ servers, and not previous versions. Subsequently, if these plugins don't work for your server, either update your server(if it's below version 1.8) or use the original plugins.

- As far as I know, the plugins here should work for 1.8, however, these plugins have yet to be tested on any version.

### Why?
A while ago, I contacted the author to check if the source code was available for his plugins because it no longer seemed to work anymore on newer servers.

He agreed to release the source code because he was no longer maintaining it, as a result, his entire plugin collection is not released, so here I am updating these plugins to work for newer versions :).
